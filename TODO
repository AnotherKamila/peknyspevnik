step 0:
  ✔ build + watch @done (13-08-09 17:01)
  ☐ tests

templating:
  ☐ use Shadow DOM for components (for encapsulation)
  ☐ find a way to neatly declare the templates (using HTML imports or javascript?)

screens:
  ☐ /settings: settings screen
  ☐ /{query}:
    query is interpreted either as `<author>[/<title>]` (iff there is an exact match) or `string` (show all matches -- tags before authors before song titles before fulltext matches); also allow `+<fuzzy tag match>` and `*<fuzzy author match>` anywhere
    ☐ for exactly one result: song view
    ☐ otherwise: results list

Modules:
  ☐ routing
  ☐ templating / DOM manipulation
  ☐ DB+data store
  ☐ song view
  ☐ settings store + UI

UI:
  ☐ nav bar
    ☐ back button
    ☐ search/filter input
      ☐ works for filtering settings, too
    ☐ if in settings: back to song view button
  ☐ menu button
    ☐ group quick settings -> font size, toggle display of stuff, toggle autoscroll
    ☐ transpose / whatever
    ☐ settings, about

server:
  ☐ @eventually make a public song database
